This project is developed using a Flask application. The core functionality involves creating a `timetable.json` file that contains data for all the timeslots of each day, essentially forming a time schedule. The data is displayed using a simple Bootstrap framework combined with HTML to provide a clean and responsive user interface.

Key Features:

- Flask-based backend for handling data and server-side logic.
- JSON file (`timetable.json`) for storing and managing the schedule data.
- Bootstrap framework for a responsive and visually appealing front-end.
- HTML for structuring the web pages and displaying the schedule data.

This project aims to provide an efficient and user-friendly way to manage and view time schedules.
